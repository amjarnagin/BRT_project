# Parking search caused congestion: Where's all the fuss?
## Reading Response
Weinberger, Millard-Ball, and Hampshire’s paper develops both new definitions and a new method to quantify excess vehicle travel due to a search for parking – also known as “cruising.” No rigorous estimates of cruising exist, and the commonly-used statistic of 30% of urban traffic as parking search is a misinterpretation in a study by the parking guru, Donald Shoup. The researchers’ study defines cruising as the difference between the length of the driver’s actual rote and the shortest path and only includes travel that occurs after the driver reaches a 400-meter radius of the destination. For the two areas studied (Ann Arbor and San Francisco), the analysis finds that cruising affects 5-6% of trips and accounts for less than 1% of vehicle miles traveled.

As the authors acknowledge, cruising is incredibly difficult to quantify, and the relevant data are so highly contextual that the conclusions are somewhat imprecise despite several methods to control for other types of travel. The analysis uses three distinct sources of data: GPS traces with video from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, a commercial anonymized dataset of trip segments, and California Household Travel Survey travel diaries with GPS traces. However, without knowing the purpose of every trip, it is difficult to know if driving that deviates from the shortest route is a result of parking search, pick-ups or drop-offs, irregular streets, congestion, inattention or a simpler but less-direct route. Reported behavior is also an issue, as drivers tend to overstate time spent looking for parking.

I found the article interesting because it explained the process of cleaning and manipulating new data sources and pairing them with existing data, then refining the method of analysis to correct for errors discovered while interpreting the initial results and spot-checking individual results for reasonableness.
